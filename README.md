## Windows Bat File

Can use run.bat to run on windows. If Python isn't installed, the script will attempt to install it via **winget** automatically.

## Windows quick start
Run:
```
scripts\run.ps1
```
If Python isn't installed, the script will attempt to install it via **winget** automatically.

## macOS / Linux quick start
Run:
```
./scripts/run.sh
```
- If Python 3 is missing and **Homebrew** is available, the script will install it (`brew install python`).
- If Homebrew isn't available, the script prints one-line instructions to install Python, then re-run.

Open http://localhost:8080 when the server says it's running.
